**TeluguScript** is a programming language designed to honor *Telugu Talli* and celebrate the beauty of the Telugu language in the programming world. It is a transpiler that converts Telugu syntax into JavaScript, making coding an expressive and meaningful experience for Telugu-speaking developers.

With **TeluguScript**, developers can write code in Telugu, using native Telugu words as keywords and syntax. This allows for a deeper connection to the language while coding, making the development process more inclusive and culturally rich.

## Keywords

Here are some of the core keywords in TeluguScript:

- **maaredhi**: `let`
- **sthiramaina**: `const`
- **pani**: `function`
- **phalitam**: `return`
- **edi untey**: `if`
- **lekapote**: `else`

## Example Code

Here is an example of how code can be written in TeluguScript:

```teluguscript
pani chinna_pati(peyaru, vayasu) {
    cheppu("Perugu: " + peyaru);
    cheppu("Vayasu: " + vayasu);
}

maaredhi peyaru = "Siddhartha";
sthiramaina vayasu = 25;

chinna_pati(peyaru, vayasu);
```

This code, when transpiled, will be converted into the following JavaScript:

```javascript
function chinna_pati(name, age) {
    console.log("Name: " + name);
    console.log("Age: " + age);
}

let name = "Siddhartha";
const age = 25;

chinna_pati(name, age);
```

## Special Mention

I was inspired by **TempleOS** created by **Terry A. Davis**. While I may not be as legendary as him, I share the same extreme passion for computer science that he had. His unique vision and dedication to his craft serve as a constant reminder of what can be achieved when you follow your passion.
