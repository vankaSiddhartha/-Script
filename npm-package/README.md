**TeluguScript** is a programming language designed to honor **Telugu Talli** and celebrate the beauty of the Telugu language in the programming world. It is a transpiler that converts Telugu syntax into JavaScript, making coding an expressive and meaningful experience for Telugu-speaking developers.

With **TeluguScript**, developers can write code in Telugu, using native Telugu words as keywords and syntax. This allows for a deeper connection to the language while coding, making the development process more inclusive and culturally rich.

## Features

- **Expressive Programming**: Write code using Telugu keywords and syntax
- **Easy to Learn**: TeluguScript's syntax is simple and intuitive, especially for native Telugu speakers
- **JavaScript Transpiler**: Converts TeluguScript code into JavaScript for execution
- **Procedural Programming Support**: Currently supports procedural programming paradigms
- **Npm Installable**: Easy installation via npm

## Installation

Install TeluguScript using npm:

```bash
npm install teluguscript
```

## Keywords

Here are the core keywords in TeluguScript:

### Variable Declarations
- `maredhi`: `let`
- `maranadhi`: `const`

### Control Flow
- `edi itey`: `if`
- `lekapote`: `else`
- `oka vela`: `else if`
- `malle itey`: `while`
- `malle`: `for`

### Functions
- `pani`: `function`
- `phalitam`: `return`

### Logging
- `cheppu`: `console.log`

### Object-Related
- `paddathi`: `class`
- `edi`: `this`
- `kotha`: `new`

## Planned Language Enhancements

We are actively working on expanding TeluguScript's capabilities:
- Syntax highlighting support
- Enhanced code editor integration
- Advanced programming paradigm support
- Improved transpilation techniques
- Richer language constructs and keywords

## Example Code

### Basic Example
```teluguscript
pani chinna_pani(name, age) {
    cheppu("Peru: " + name);
    cheppu("Vayasu: " + age);
}

maredhi name = "Siddhartha";
maranadhi age = 21;
chinna_pani(name, age);
```

Transpiled JavaScript:
```javascript
function chinna_pani(name, age) {
    console.log("Peru: " + name);
    console.log("Vayasu: " + age);
}

let name = "Siddhartha";
const age = 25;
chinna_pani(name, age);
```

### Running TeluguScript

Execute TeluguScript files using npx:

```bash
npx telugu your_file.tel
```

## Special Mention

Inspired by **TempleOS** created by **Terry A. Davis**. While not as legendary, we share the same extreme passion for computer science and innovative programming approaches.
